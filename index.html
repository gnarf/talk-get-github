            I've contributed to a lot of jQuery teams.  The Core Team, UI Team, Infrastructure Team, and the Foundation Board to name a few.  If you've used .animate(), or looked at a jQuery website, you've used my work. That work was all done using GitHub.

            So I want to tell you how to GitHub, but before I talk about GitHub, let's talk about Git

        <section>
<h3>So what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Git_(software)">Git</a>?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Revision Control</li>
  <li>Distributed</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Data Integrity</li>
  <li>Non-Linear Workflows</li>
  <li>Most Popular <a href="https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/eclipse-community-survey-2014-results/"><small>(source)</small></a></li>

          <aside class="notes">
            Poll: How many people have never used git? have you used other source control?
            In case you aren't familiar, git is...<br>
            → code goes in a git repository... A history of the codebase, revision, control<br>
            → distributed means every "clone" is it's own local repo (offline anyone)<br>
            → speedy because it's local for most operations<br>
            → because sha1 checksums<br>
            → non-linear... branching and mergeing are super fast, A core assumption in Git is that a change will be merged more often than it is written<br>
            → popular! yay<br><br>
            (dont advance)
            If you're curious to read more about it, or need some selling points, the wiki page is pretty great

            Another quick poll - how many of you already have a GitHub account? Do you use it for work? For open source?<br>
            For those of you that don't know - GitHub - aside from having an adorably cute mascot - is a place for hosting and collaborating on git repositories.  Their Motto → really kind of sums it up.<br>

            I want to zero in on the word "together" for a second.  What means to me is sharing our knowledge and efforts in an online space, with history for reference, and asynchrounsly.  This means you aren't tapping your co-worker on the shoulder and demanding they give you time, and we all get to be more productive.<br>

            For those of you not using GitHub at work, here's a few selling points in case you want to convice your team.<br>
            Building on top of git's powerful tools for managing your code, GitHub adds a bunch of great features.<br>
            → They have an Integrated Issue Tracking system which is something every project needs to solve.  You can of course disable it if you already track your issues elsewhere.<br>
            → Collaborative Code Review! .... Pull Requests A.K.A. "PR"s are probably the most important feature offered by GitHub and I'll tell you all about em in a minute or two.<br>
            → github is also Team oriented.  you can create organizations, group them by teams, and control access to repos individually.<br>
            → GitHub's website is built using their own API.  Almost anything you can do on GitHub can be done with the very well documented API.<br>
            → And because the API is awesome, it integrates with a lot of services.  Flowdock, HipChat, Slack, IRC, Jenkins, Travis, JIRA, the list goes on and on.<br>
            → It's free for public repositories, even organizations!  If you aren't trying to hide it from the world, you'll never pay a dime. If you pay you unlock private repositories.<br>
            → If you pay even more you can get Enterprise, and run it on your own servers.<br>

              Speaking for jQuery at least... Every other open source project I've contributed too was equally happy to have outsiders.<br>
              Sometimes what we really need is a fresh pair of eyes to tell us something is greek instead of javascript.  Just be friendly and try your best to be helpful to the community.
